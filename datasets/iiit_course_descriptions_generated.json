It begins with an introduction to the VLSI design flow, MOSFET/FinFET transistors, and the detailed analysis of the CMOS inverter's static and dynamic characteristics (delay, power, noise margin). The core curriculum extends these principles to the design of fundamental digital building blocks like gates, latches, and flip-flops. A major emphasis is placed on delay optimization for multistage logic circuits using the Method of Logical Effort, and exploring alternative logic styles such as Pass Transistor and Dynamic Logic. Concluding with an introduction to system design using HDL, students will gain the skills to analyze, design, and verify delay-optimized combinational and sequential CMOS circuits.",

    "Course Title": "Work, Entrepreneurship and Technology in Contemporary Societies.",
    "Course Code": "HS2.303",
    "Course Description": "This course offers a critical sociological examination of the interconnected spheres of work, entrepreneurship, and technology in contemporary societies. It begins by exploring the foundational theories and historical discourses of work, covering diverse forms, including formal, informal, productive, and reproductive labor, and analyzing the influence of social institutions like gender and caste. The curriculum then introduces the concept of entrepreneurship, investigating different types, from Silicon Valley to self-employed enterprises, and the role of finance, capital, and social networks in these processes. A final module focuses on the historical transformation of technology and its role as an institution that shapes work relations and contingent labor. Students will develop a critical outlook to analyze how technology drives and is adopted within these deeply connected economic engagements.",

Subsequently, the students would have a sound knowledge of how global economic forces shape local work arrangements.",
      "CO-3 Students will be able to distinguish how economic engagements (work and entrepreneurship) differ in the context of the global north and the global south. They would be able to engage in the transformation of economic engagements in the past century. Thus, the students would engage in diverse working conditions (formal and informal) and spread self-employed entrepreneurial enterprises.",
      "CO-4 Students will be able to analyze how social institutions (such as technology, gender, class, and caste) shape entrepreneurial enterprises and work engagements. The students will be introduced to concepts of embeddedness, networks, and communities that shape the economic lives of individuals.",

With an appreciation of multiple economic scales of entrepreneurship and work, the course will highlight the role of capital, labor, and technology in creating deeply connected processes.",
      "CO-6 Students will develop a critical outlook on how technology shapes economic engagements (work and entrepreneurship) and how there is a bottom-up adoption and usage of technology that gives rise to unintended economic consequences. 3."
