    "Course Title": "Work, Entrepreneurship and Technology in Contemporary Societies.",
    "Course Code": "HS2.303",
    "Course Description": "This course offers a critical sociological examination of the interconnected spheres of work, entrepreneurship, and technology in contemporary societies. It begins by exploring the foundational theories and historical discourses of work, covering diverse forms, including formal, informal, productive, and reproductive labor, and analyzing the influence of social institutions like gender and caste. The curriculum then introduces the concept of entrepreneurship, investigating different types, from Silicon Valley to self-employed enterprises, and the role of finance, capital, and social networks in these processes. A final module focuses on the historical transformation of technology and its role as an institution that shapes work relations and contingent labor. Students will develop a critical outlook to analyze how technology drives and is adopted within these deeply connected economic engagements.",

    "Course Title": "Wireless Communications",
    "Course Code": "EC5.407",
    "Course Description": "This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental operational and design problems of modern Wireless Communications systems. It begins with a review of digital communication basics and an overview of current wireless standards and generations. The core curriculum delves into channel modeling, focusing on multipath propagation, pathloss, and various types of fading (frequency and time selectivity). It then progresses to essential mitigation techniques, covering the design and performance analysis of spatial, time, and frequency diversity techniques. The course concludes with advanced topics, including Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems, capacity analysis, and a detailed examination of Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Massive MIMO, preparing students to design and evaluate rate and error performance of multi-antenna transceivers.",
