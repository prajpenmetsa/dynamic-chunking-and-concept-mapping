"Work, Entrepreneurship and Technology in Contemporary Societies.","CO-3 Students will be able to distinguish how economic engagements (work and entrepreneurship) differ in the context of the global north and the global south. They would be able to engage in the transformation of economic engagements in the past century. Thus, the students would engage in diverse working conditions (formal and informal) and spread self-employed entrepreneurial enterprises.",Analyze,"The verb 'distinguish' implies breaking down differences and identifying key characteristics, which falls under the 'Analyze' level.",4,Higher-Order Thinking,Other
"Work, Entrepreneurship and Technology in Contemporary Societies.","CO-4 Students will be able to analyze how social institutions (such as technology, gender, class, and caste) shape entrepreneurial enterprises and work engagements. The students will be introduced to concepts of embeddedness, networks, and communities that shape the economic lives of individuals.",Analyze,"The verb 'analyze' directly indicates the breaking down of complex relationships between social institutions and economic activities, fitting the 'Analyze' level.",4,Higher-Order Thinking,Other
"Work, Entrepreneurship and Technology in Contemporary Societies.","CO-5 Students will understand how work and entrepreneurship, rather than being binaries, are deeply interconnected. With an appreciation of multiple economic scales of entrepreneurship and work, the course will highlight the role of capital, labor, and technology in creating deeply connected processes.",Understand,"The verb 'understand' indicates comprehension of the relationship between work and entrepreneurship, aligning with the 'Understand' level.",2,Lower-Order Thinking,Other
"Work, Entrepreneurship and Technology in Contemporary Societies.",CO-6 Students will develop a critical outlook on how technology shapes economic engagements (work and entrepreneurship) and how there is a bottom-up adoption and usage of technology that gives rise to unintended economic consequences. 3.,Evaluate,"The phrase 'develop a critical outlook' suggests making judgments and forming opinions about the impact of technology, fitting the 'Evaluate' level.",5,Higher-Order Thinking,Other
